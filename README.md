# DL_individual-project-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Kidney-stone-Detection-

Abstract—Kidney stones, a prevalent health concern, can cause
severe complications if not detected early, leading to extreme
pain or life-threatening blockages. While small stones may pass
through the urinary tract unnoticed, larger stones (over 5 mm)
can obstruct the ureter and require medical intervention. This
project addresses the urgent need for early detection of kidney
stones through a hybrid deep learning approach that combines
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines
(SVM), complemented by a user-friendly Graphical User
Interface (GUI). The CNN model, achieving an accuracy of 91%,
efficiently extracts critical features from CT scan images, while
the SVM classifier, which then categorizes images into ”Normal”
and ”Stone” classes. Trained and evaluated on a dataset of
3,000 CT images (2,000 Normal and 1,000 Stone), this hybrid
model leverages CNN’s feature extraction strengths alongside
SVM’s classification precision to improve diagnostic accuracy.
The GUI, developed with Tkinter, allows users to easily interact
with the model, enabling seamless image selection and prediction.
This integrated approach not only enhances prediction efficiency
but also offers a practical and accessible solution for early
kidney stone detection, supporting timely medical intervention
and improved patient outcomes.
